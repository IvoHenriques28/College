Open project "LineNetServer" using Visual Studio and run it to start up the server.
Then initialize 2 versions of the game, 1 can be in Unity itself and another with the build
The first version to press "Start" on the game will be the Hunter, while the 2nd will be the Hunted

Warning: Only when 2 versions of the game are initialized does the game fully begin, and if you shut down 1 of them
before the game ends, to restart you need to restart the server and both versions
